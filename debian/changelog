scalemail (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer depend on debconf.
  * Don't use Twisted's initializeMaildir for creating maildir
    folders, as it wants to create a Trash folder, and having a
    maildir/.folder/.Trash is bad.

scalemail (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Almost reimplemented from scratch; this is no longer the prototype.
  * Typo in description. Closes: #125337.
  * Scalemail is now arch-independant, as it should have always
    been. Closes: #116896.
  * /etc/ldap/schema/scalemail.schema is a conffile. Closes: #132115.
  * Well-defined schema, real OID, etc. Shouldn't conflict with standard
    attributeTypes. Closes: #98383.
  * Got rid of /usr/doc support.
  * Upgraded policy to 3.5.6
  * Removed built-in canonicalization support, it's just really not
    related to scalemail and used to assume things that really aren't true
    for virtual users, such as users actually having uid's. If you want the
    canonicalization features, feel free to add a suitable LDAP map entry
    yourself; you can use the same entries in LDAP easily.
  * Follow Twisted mail API changes.
  * Follow Ldaptor API changes.
  * Fully use DNS SRV records.
  * Support receiving emails to user@scalemail.example.com, if and only if
    user belongs to a backend box that is server by this host. (Add later
    support for relaying to correct backend box.)
  * Configuration file support.
  * Support "baseless" operation, for nicer configurability.

scalemail (0.0.2001.05.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix postfix/main.cf continuation line handling; used to blindly
    append continuation lines to value even when the config lines really
    belonged to a different variable later in the file. Closes: #97911.
  * Make backup copies of /etc/postfix/main.cf, if it is ever edited.
    Closes: #97910.
