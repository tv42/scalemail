How to use the autoresponder:
----------------------------

WARNING: Twisted (as of 1.3.0-5) contains two severe bugs that
may cause lost mail and actually prevent using the autoresponder.
See http://bugs.debian.org/289993 for more.


In the LDAP entry for an account, add one or more instances of the
attributetype scaleMailAway. The values should look like:

away	=	start SP stop [(LF / CRLF) message]

start	=	isotime

stop	=	isotime

isotime	=	year "-" month "-" day
		[ "T" hour [ ":" minute [ ":" second ] ] ]

Where year, month, day, hour, minute and second should be obvious, and
message is as defined in RFC 2822.

(That is, two ISO 8601 timestamps separated by space on the first
line, the rest is an optional mail message.)

During the time between start and stop, the email message given is
sent as an autoresponse to anyone sending email to the account. A
single person gets atmost a limited number of autoresponses per time
interval.

If the message given is a MIME multipart message, the original message
is attached to it.

Special header fields starting with "X-Scalemail-" can configure
the following things:

X-Scalemail-Subject

	will be used as subject prefix in the autoresponse




PS. A lot of thanks to Bruce Guenter for his qmail-autoresponder
    software (http://untroubled.org/qmail-autoresponder/), it
    provided a lot of inspiration for scalemail.gone.

PPS. scalemail.gone is meant to be a pluggable engine, with no
     dependency on LDAP or Scalemail itself. Using it in other
     projects should be quite easy.
